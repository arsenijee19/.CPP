# Welcome to ".cpp"

## Introduction

Welcome to my ".cpp" repository, where I have decided to share some of my projects and programming solutions with the whole world. I'll do my best to keep this folder up-to-date, along with the explanation of every single file uploaded.

## What does ".cpp" mean?

The extension ".cpp" stands for a C++ program language file extension, which at the same time represents my favorite computer language environment to work in.
